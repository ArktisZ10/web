# About this website

## Built with Deno and Aleph.js

Aleph.js is modern framework that doesn't need **webpack** or other bundler
since it uses the [ES Module] syntax during development. Every module only needs
to be compiled once, when a module changes, Aleph.js just needs to re-compile
that single module. There is no time wasted _re-bundling_ everytime a change is
made. This, along with Hot Module Replacement (**HMR**) and **Fast Refresh**,
leads to instant updates in the browser.

Aleph.js uses modern tools to build your app. It transpiles code using [swc] in
WASM with high performance, and bundles modules with [esbuild] at optimization
time extremely fast.

Aleph.js works on top of **Deno**, a _simple_, _modern_ and _secure_ runtime for
JavaScript and TypeScript. All dependencies are imported using URLs, and managed
by Deno cache system. No `package.json` and `node_modules` directory needed.
