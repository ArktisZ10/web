## Aleph.js as framework

*From the [Aleph.js](https://alephjs.org/docs) documentation:*

> **Aleph.js** (or **Aleph** or** א **or** 阿莱夫, ˈɑːlɛf) is a fullstack framework 
> in [Deno](https://deno.com/). Inspired by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/),
> [Remix](https://remix.run/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
> 
>
>> The name is taken from the book
>>[The Aleph](http://phinnweb.org/links/literature/borges/aleph.html) by **Jorge
>> Luis Borges.**
> 
>
> Aleph.js is modern framework that doesn't need webpack or other bundler since it
> uses the ES Module syntax during development. Every module only needs to be
> compiled once, when a module changes, Aleph.js just needs to re-compile that
> single module. There is no time wasted re-bundling everytime a change is made.
> This, along with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and Fast Refresh, leads to instant
> updates in the browser.
> 
>
> Aleph.js uses modern tools to build your app. It transpiles code using swc in WASM
> with high performance, and bundles modules with esbuild at optimization time 
> extremely fast.
> 
>
> Aleph.js works on top of Deno, a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript
> and TypeScript. All dependencies are imported using URLs, and managed by Deno cache
> system. No package.json and node_modules directory needed.
